# Best Case

## Input set:

If the amount of the numbers in the plain text file is N, then the best case is N numbers that correspond only to the initial position [0] to the array.

## Formula

The algorithm makes N comparisons to find the repeated numbers.

# Worst Case

## Input set

If the amount of the numbers in the plain text is N, then the worst case is N different numbers in the plain text.

## Formula

The algorithm makes N*N= N^2 comparisons to find the repeated numbers because it has any repeated characthers.
